/*
Goal:
At some point in time, the current queue will contain 0 or more transactions.
At this point in time, we may want to begin transitioning to another queue.

In order to transition to a new queue, we must do the following:
1) generate the new wallet/queue combo
2) create a new tx on *the current queue* that calls appropriate transition function
3) as soon as transition function is confirmed, copy all higher nonce txns from old queue to new queue

step 2 can have multiple modes:
- insertion modes (essentially choose whether transition function is `replaced` (and where) or simply appended):
  - immediate (gets sent at lowest liquid nonce, replacing existing if necessary)
  - end (gets appended to end of queue)
- completion mode
  - "lazy": the transition function tx will always be at the end of the queue (both appending and replacing bump it up a nonce)
  - "aggressive": the transition function cannot be replaced

Note: the immediate insertion mode and aggressive completion mode may be cool to have, but probably wouldn't get much use
in the context of New Bedford. For now I'm just going to implement "end" and "lazy"
